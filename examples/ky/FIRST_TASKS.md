# First Tasks: sindresorhus/ky

Suggested starter tasks for new contributors, organized by difficulty.

## Beginner Tasks (Safe Small Wins)

### Document Node.js version requirement

**Difficulty:** beginner | **Category:** docs

Add a short prerequisite note in the Install section that Node.js >=18 is required, matching package.json engines.

**Why this matters:** Keeps contributor setup instructions aligned with the supported runtime.

**Files to look at:**
- `readme.md`
- `package.json`

### Document ky.stop and ky.retry helpers

**Difficulty:** beginner | **Category:** docs

Add a brief README snippet showing how to stop retries in beforeRetry and how to trigger retries from afterResponse.

**Why this matters:** These helpers are part of the public API but are easy to miss without explicit docs.

**Files to look at:**
- `readme.md`
- `source/index.ts`
- `source/core/Ky.ts`

### Test prefixUrl leading-slash validation

**Difficulty:** beginner | **Category:** test

Add an AVA test that asserts ky throws when prefixUrl is used with an input starting with '/'.

**Why this matters:** Guards against regressions in URL normalization behavior.

**Files to look at:**
- `source/core/Ky.ts`
- `test/fetch.ts`

### Test searchParams undefined filtering

**Difficulty:** beginner | **Category:** test

Verify that undefined values are removed while null values are preserved when building search params.

**Why this matters:** Confirms documented query normalization behavior.

**Files to look at:**
- `source/core/Ky.ts`
- `test/fetch.ts`


## Intermediate Tasks

### Test beforeError hook mutation

**Difficulty:** intermediate | **Category:** test

Add a test to ensure beforeError can change error name/message and is invoked before throwing.

**Why this matters:** Improves coverage of hook customization logic.

**Files to look at:**
- `source/core/Ky.ts`
- `test/hooks.ts`

### Test shouldRetry precedence

**Difficulty:** intermediate | **Category:** test

Create a test showing that retry.shouldRetry overrides status code and timeout checks.

**Why this matters:** Ensures custom retry logic remains the top-priority decision point.

**Files to look at:**
- `source/core/Ky.ts`
- `test/hooks.ts`

### Refactor Retry-After parsing into a utility

**Difficulty:** intermediate | **Category:** refactor

Extract the Retry-After/RateLimit parsing logic from Ky.#calculateRetryDelay into a helper in source/utils and add focused tests.

**Why this matters:** Simplifies the retry flow and makes header parsing easier to test.

**Files to look at:**
- `source/core/Ky.ts`
- `source/utils/normalize.ts`
- `test/fetch.ts`


## Advanced Tasks

### Improve KyInstance typing for create/extend

**Difficulty:** advanced | **Category:** feature

Tighten TypeScript overloads so defaults passed to ky.create/ky.extend are reflected in the returned instance types.

**Why this matters:** Enhances developer experience for advanced TypeScript consumers.

**Files to look at:**
- `source/types/ky.ts`
- `source/index.ts`

### Add progress hook streaming tests

**Difficulty:** advanced | **Category:** test

Use a large payload helper to test onDownloadProgress/onUploadProgress streaming behavior and error handling.

**Why this matters:** Validates stream-based progress support across environments.

**Files to look at:**
- `source/core/Ky.ts`
- `source/utils/body.ts`
- `test/helpers/create-large-file.ts`
- `test/fetch.ts`
