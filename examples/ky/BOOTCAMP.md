> Tiny Fetch-based HTTP client with ergonomic helpers, retries, and hooks.

Ky is a small, dependency-free HTTP client built on the Fetch API for modern runtimes like browsers and Node.js. It adds method shortcuts, typed response helpers, retry and timeout handling, and hook-based lifecycle extensions. The source exports a factory that creates Ky instances with merged defaults and exposes helper symbols for retry control.

## Quick Facts

| | |
|---|---|
| **Languages** | TypeScript |
| **Frameworks** | None |
| **Build System** | npm |
| **Package Manager** | N/A |

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >=18
- npm

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies: npm install
2. Run tests and lint/build: npm test
3. Build distribution output: npm run build
4. If running browser-related tests, install Playwright browsers: npx playwright install --with-deps

**Key commands:** `npm install`, `npm test`, `npm run build`, `npx playwright install --with-deps`

## Project Structure

- `source` - Library TypeScript source and public exports.
- `source/core` - Core request engine, retry, hooks, and response helpers.
- `source/errors` - Error types thrown by the client.
- `source/utils` - Shared helpers for merging options, normalization, and body/timeout handling.
- `source/types` - Public TypeScript type definitions for options, hooks, and responses.

## If You Only Have 30 Minutes

1. Read this document
2. Run the dev server: `npm install`
3. Pick one of these starter tasks:

- **Document Node.js version requirement**: Add a short prerequisite note in the Install section that Node.js >=18 is required, matching package.json engines.
- **Document ky.stop and ky.retry helpers**: Add a brief README snippet showing how to stop retries in beforeRetry and how to trigger retries from afterResponse.
- **Test prefixUrl leading-slash validation**: Add an AVA test that asserts ky throws when prefixUrl is used with an input starting with '/'.
